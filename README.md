# Web Scraping with Python 
  This is my first project created to reinforce concepts learned from the IBM Data Science course. It is a simple Python web scraper using     BeautifulSoup to extract content from websites.

## Project Description 
  This project is a Python-based web scaraping tool that allows users to input a URL. The tool then fetches the webpage, extract data from     specific HTML elements such as ('h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'p', 'td', 'tr', 'div') and prints the clean text from the webpage

## Installation and Setup
  1. Clone the repository:
     git clone "url"
  2. Install dependencies:
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4

## Usage
  python main.py

## Features
  Fetch content from any webpage using requests.
  Parse HTML and extract data using BeautifulSoup
  Print clean text from specific HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and table rows.

## Error Handling
  The program handles common HTTP errors and HTML parsing issues. If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be shown to the user.
